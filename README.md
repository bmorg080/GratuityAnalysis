# GratuityAnalysisProject
While working as a function waiter, I compiled a list of the events I worked, the staff on the event with me, and the tips we received.

In this project, I run analysis using the Pandas library on these data to discover insights such as which events yield the highest gratuity, and which of my coworkers yield the most tips.
